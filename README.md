 Create the Earthquake Visualization

    # Map
     - TileLayer loads without error 
    
     - Connects to geojson API using D3 without error 
    
     - Markers with size corresponding to earthquake magnitude 
    
     - A legend showing the depth and their corresponding color 
    
    # Data Points
     - Data points scale with magnitude level
    
     - Data points colors change with depth level 
    
     - Each point has a tooltip with the Magnitude, the location and depth 
    
     - All data points load in the correct locations
